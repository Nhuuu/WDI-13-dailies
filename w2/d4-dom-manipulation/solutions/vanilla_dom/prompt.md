### Vanilla Javascript DOM manipulation

* Query for the page title and log the element to the console.
* Query for the unordered list and log the element to the console.
* Add a fourth item to the list.
* Move the image so that it renders below the list.
* Make the page title red (by adding a class to the page title). Hint: Look at the .css file to see what classes exist.
* Make the list items blue (add classes to each *list item*, not to the ul element).
* Make the description green.
* Add a red footer paragraph to the page with the id "page-footer".

Bonus: Delete all the HTML and build the page using JavaScript.

* Instead of having that starter HTML in the page, write JavaScript to **construct** this page.
