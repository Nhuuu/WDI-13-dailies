## Overview
Computational thinking is a skill that takes a lot of practice, but there are other ways to master it beyond just writing code! Practicing computational thinking will help you develop a strong foundation before you start learning JavaScript. As you try these exercises, keep in mind that the answers are not obvious: you'll have to "think outside the box!" 

> Instructor note: After the 10 minutes are up for each question, take five minutes to choose a pair of students and have them talk through the logic of their solution.

## Directions

Pair with a partner and use computational thinking to answer the following word problems. 

There will be many times when you're working through abstract or complex programming problems where it will be critical that you are able to visualize and break down the problem.

As you're working through these questions, use a pen and paper or a whiteboard marker to create diagrams or jot things down to visualize the components of the problem and break it into smaller pieces.

You have 10 minutes for each question. Good luck!


#### Question One
A traveler comes to a fork in the road which leads to two villages. In one village, the people always tell lies; in the other village, the people always tell the truth. The traveler needs to conduct business in the village where everyone tells the truth. A man from one of the villages is standing in the middle of the fork, but there is no indication of which village he is from. The traveler approaches the man and asks him one question. From the villager's answer, he knows which road to follow.

_What did the traveler ask?_


<!-- Answer: Which way leads to where you live? -->


#### Question Two
A man walks into an art gallery and concentrates on one picture in particular. The museum curator notices this and asks the man why he is so interested in that one painting. The man replies, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son."

_Who is in the painting?_


<!-- Answer: It's him in the painting! -->


#### Question Three
Name four days of the week that start with the letter "t."

<!-- Answer: Tuesday, Thursday, Today, Tomorrow -->


#### Question Four
A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. How does the man do it?

<!--
Answer:
Carry chicken
Carry fox, grab chicken on return
Carry corn, leave chicken
Carry chicken
-->

#### Bonus Question (If time permits)

Alright! Now for a problem that is a little less abstract. Write out the steps you could take to shuffle a deck of cards. 

Try to create a diagram to visualize and break down the problem. It may be helpful to first imagine that you are working with 10 cards and then work your way up to a full deck.

<!--
Sample Answer:

1. You start with the last card in the list (the top card in the deck, if you like).
2. You pick another card at random between the first one and your selected one.
3. You swap these two cards.
4. You pick the last-but-one card in the list (the second card in the deck), and repeat #1-#3 until you reach the bottom of the deck.
