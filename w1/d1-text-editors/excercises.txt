1. Operation Poet Extraction

	Problem: I would really like a list of popular poets. 100 should do.

	a) Go to http://100.best-poems.net/top-100-best-poems.html
	b) Copy all the poem, poet information into a new file in Sublime
	c) Edit the file to only contain poet names, one on each line. Describe the insight and shortcuts you used to achieve this

	Bonus: How could you further edit the data to be an array of strings? (such as: ["Robert Frost", "William Blake", ...])


2. Finding That Special Plugin

	Problem: All these numbers your boss just gave you? They actually need to be 1-indexed, not 0-indexed. Have fun counting.

	7 8 17 3 2 14 6 11 15 10 13 4 9 12 0 5 1 16 19 18

	a) Do some research. What operation do we need to do? Can Google help us? (Google-fu should lead us here: https://gist.github.com/dtao/2788978)
	b) That plugin is nice and all, but it's simple to write our own. Install the IncrementCommand plugin.
	c) Add away!
